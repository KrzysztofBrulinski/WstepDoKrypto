'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people lack of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord, heavens above

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me

'Cause I'm no prophet or messiah
You should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
